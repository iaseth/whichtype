# whichtype
[`whichtype`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/whichtype) is a small `JavaScript/TypeScript` library for checking the type of your variables, written in `TypeScript`.

I felt the need for `whichtype` when I was working on [`iaseth/josn`](https://github.com/iaseth/josn).

I am using [`readmix`](https://github.com/iaseth/readmix) for generating this README.
You can view the source file [here](https://github.com/iaseth/whichtype/blob/master/README.md.rx).
